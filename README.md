# AR-Bounceball

Do we create space-time? 

For the first time, it is possible to see the quantum world from multiple points of view at once. This hints at something very strange â€“ that reality only takes shape when we interact with each other

It all started with Albert Einsteinâ€™s theory of special relativity, which showed us that lengths of space and durations of time vary depending on who is looking  A new perspective on the fabric of reality. ARCore SDK Implementation, Android Bouncing ball App
